# EC2 Purchase Options

Amazon EC2 provides several purchasing options to help you optimize costs based on your needs:

## On-Demand Instances
- **Description**: Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted.

## Reserved Instances
- **Description**: Make a one-time payment for a significant discount compared to On-Demand pricing.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for steady-state or predictable usage.

## Spot Instances
- **Description**: Bid for unused EC2 capacity at a potentially lower price.
- **Use Case**: Great for flexible start and end times, and applications that are fault-tolerant.

## Savings Plans
- **Description**: Commit to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a 1 or 3 year term.
- **Use Case**: Provides the most flexibility and savings compared to Reserved Instances.

## Dedicated Hosts
- **Description**: Physical servers dedicated for your use.
- **Use Case**: Useful for meeting compliance requirements and reducing costs by using existing server-bound software licenses.

## Dedicated Instances
- **Description**: Instances that run on hardware dedicated to a single customer.
- **Use Case**: Suitable for workloads where your compliance requirements do not support multi-tenant virtualization.

## Capacity Reservations
- **Description**: Reserve capacity for your EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration.
- **Use Case**: Ensures you have the capacity you need when you need it.

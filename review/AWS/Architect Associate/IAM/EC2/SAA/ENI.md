# Elastic Network Interface (ENI) in EC2

An Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is a virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It is a logical networking component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card.

## Key Features

- **Primary and Secondary ENIs**: Each instance in a VPC has a primary network interface (eth0). You can attach additional secondary network interfaces to an instance.
- **Elastic IP Addresses**: You can associate an Elastic IP address with an ENI.
- **Security Groups**: You can assign one or more security groups to an ENI.
- **MAC Address**: Each ENI has a unique MAC address.
- **Private IP Addresses**: You can assign one or more private IP addresses to an ENI.

## Use Cases

- **High Availability**: Use multiple ENIs to provide high availability and failover.
- **Network Appliances**: Create network appliances such as load balancers and firewalls.
- **Management Network**: Separate management network traffic from application traffic.

## Managing ENIs

You can manage ENIs using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or AWS SDKs. Common tasks include:

- **Creating an ENI**: Create a new ENI and attach it to an instance.
- **Attaching/Detaching an ENI**: Attach an ENI to an instance or detach it.
- **Modifying an ENI**: Change the attributes of an ENI, such as security groups or IP addresses.

## Example Commands

### Create an ENI

```sh
aws ec2 create-network-interface --subnet-id subnet-12345678 --description "My ENI" --groups sg-12345678
```

### Attach an ENI to an Instance

```sh
aws ec2 attach-network-interface --network-interface-id eni-12345678 --instance-id i-12345678 --device-index 1
```

### Detach an ENI from an Instance

```sh
aws ec2 detach-network-interface --attachment-id eni-attach-12345678
```

### Delete an ENI

```sh
aws ec2 delete-network-interface --network-interface-id eni-12345678
```

## Conclusion

Elastic Network Interfaces provide flexibility and scalability for managing network configurations in AWS EC2 instances. They are essential for creating robust and highly available network architectures.

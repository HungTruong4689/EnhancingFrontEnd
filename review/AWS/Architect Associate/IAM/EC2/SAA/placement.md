# Placement Group

A placement group is a feature in Amazon EC2 that determines how instances are placed on underlying hardware. It can influence the performance and availability of your applications.

## Types of Placement Groups
1. **Cluster Placement Group**: Instances are placed in a single Availability Zone. This provides low-latency network performance.
2. **Partition Placement Group**: Instances are divided into logical partitions. Each partition is isolated from the failures of other partitions.
3. **Spread Placement Group**: Instances are placed on distinct hardware to reduce correlated failures.

## Pros
- **Cluster Placement Group**:
    - Low-latency network performance.
    - High throughput.
- **Partition Placement Group**:
    - Isolation from hardware failures.
    - Suitable for large distributed and replicated workloads.
- **Spread Placement Group**:
    - Reduced risk of simultaneous failures.
    - Suitable for small critical instances.

## Cons
- **Cluster Placement Group**:
    - Limited to a single Availability Zone.
    - Not suitable for all instance types.
- **Partition Placement Group**:
    - Limited to specific instance types.
    - More complex to manage.
- **Spread Placement Group**:
    - Limited to seven running instances per Availability Zone.
    - May not be suitable for large-scale deployments.

## Use Cases
- **Cluster Placement Group**:
    - High-performance computing (HPC) applications.
    - Big data workloads.
- **Partition Placement Group**:
    - HDFS, HBase, and Cassandra.
    - Large-scale distributed systems.
- **Spread Placement Group**:
    - Critical applications that require high availability.
    - Applications that need to avoid simultaneous hardware failures.

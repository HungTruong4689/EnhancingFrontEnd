# Hibernate in EC2

Amazon EC2 provides the ability to hibernate instances. When you hibernate an instance, Amazon EC2 signals the operating system to perform hibernation (suspend-to-disk). The contents from the instance memory (RAM) are saved to the Amazon EBS root volume. When the instance is started again, the Amazon EBS root volume is restored to its previous state, and the RAM contents are reloaded.

## Benefits of Hibernation

- **Fast Startup**: Instances resume quickly, as the operating system does not need to reboot and applications do not need to be restarted.
- **Preserve State**: The in-memory state of applications is preserved, making it easier to maintain long-running processes.
- **Cost Savings**: You can stop and hibernate instances when they are not needed, reducing costs.

## Prerequisites

- The instance must use an Amazon EBS root volume.
- The root volume must be encrypted.
- The instance must use an HVM AMI.
- The instance must be of a supported instance type.

## How to Hibernate an EC2 Instance

1. **Stop the Instance**: Ensure the instance is in a stopped state.
2. **Enable Hibernation**: Modify the instance to enable hibernation.
3. **Start the Instance**: Start the instance and use it as needed.
4. **Hibernate the Instance**: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDK to hibernate the instance.

## Example CLI Command

```sh
aws ec2 stop-instances --instance-ids i-1234567890abcdef0 --hibernate
```

## Limitations

- Hibernation is not supported for all instance types.
- The instance cannot be hibernated for more than 60 days.
- The root volume must have enough space to store the RAM contents.

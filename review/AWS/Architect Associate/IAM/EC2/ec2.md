# Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Amazon EC2 provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware upfront, so you can develop and deploy applications faster.

## Key Features

- **Scalability**: Easily scale up or down based on demand.
- **Flexibility**: Choose from a wide variety of instance types and configurations.
- **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for the compute time you use.
- **Security**: Secure your instances with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

## Common Use Cases

- **Web Hosting**: Host websites and web applications.
- **Big Data**: Run big data applications like Hadoop and Spark.
- **Machine Learning**: Train and deploy machine learning models.
- **Batch Processing**: Perform batch processing jobs.

## Getting Started

1. **Launch an Instance**: Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to launch an instance.
2. **Connect to Your Instance**: Use SSH for Linux instances or RDP for Windows instances.
3. **Configure Security**: Set up security groups and IAM roles to control access.
4. **Monitor and Manage**: Use CloudWatch to monitor performance and manage your instances.

## Best Practices

- **Use IAM Roles**: Assign IAM roles to your instances for secure access to AWS services.
- **Automate with Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.
- **Backup with Snapshots**: Regularly create snapshots of your instances for backup and recovery.
- **Optimize Costs**: Use Reserved Instances or Spot Instances to reduce costs.

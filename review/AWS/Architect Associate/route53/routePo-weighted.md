# Route 53 Weighted Routing Policy

Amazon Route 53's weighted routing policy allows you to distribute traffic across multiple resources by assigning each resource a relative weight. This is useful for load balancing, testing new versions of applications, or directing traffic to different resources based on their capacity.

## How It Works

1. **Create Multiple Records**: Create multiple DNS records for the same domain or subdomain, each pointing to a different resource (e.g., different IP addresses or endpoints).
2. **Assign Weights**: Assign a weight to each record. The weight determines the proportion of traffic that will be routed to each resource. Weights can be any integer between 0 and 255.
3. **Traffic Distribution**: Route 53 uses the weights to determine how much traffic to send to each resource. For example, if you have two records with weights 1 and 3, Route 53 will send 25% of the traffic to the first resource and 75% to the second resource.

## Example

Suppose you have two web servers and you want to distribute traffic between them with a 70-30 split. You would create two records with the following weights:

- **Server 1**: Weight 7
- **Server 2**: Weight 3

Route 53 will route approximately 70% of the traffic to Server 1 and 30% to Server 2.

## Steps to Configure Weighted Routing

1. **Open Route 53 Console**: Go to the Route 53 console in the AWS Management Console.
2. **Select Hosted Zone**: Select the hosted zone that contains the domain name you want to configure.
3. **Create Record Set**: Click on "Create Record Set".
4. **Configure Records**: Enter the domain or subdomain, select the type (e.g., A or CNAME), and enter the value (e.g., IP address or endpoint).
5. **Set Routing Policy**: Choose "Weighted" as the routing policy.
6. **Assign Weight**: Enter the weight for the record.
7. **Repeat**: Repeat the process for each resource, assigning appropriate weights.

## Use Cases

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly or unevenly across multiple servers.
- **A/B Testing**: Direct a small percentage of traffic to a new version of an application while keeping the majority on the stable version.
- **Failover**: Gradually shift traffic from one resource to another for maintenance or upgrades.

## Considerations

- **Health Checks**: Combine weighted routing with health checks to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy resources.
- **Cost**: Be aware of the costs associated with Route 53 queries and health checks.

# Multiple Value Routing Policy in Route 53

Amazon Route 53 supports multiple value answer routing, which allows you to return multiple IP addresses in response to DNS queries. This can be useful for load balancing and redundancy.

## Key Features

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple resources.
- **Redundancy**: Provides multiple IP addresses to ensure availability if one IP address becomes unavailable.
- **Health Checks**: Route 53 can perform health checks on each IP address and only return healthy addresses in response to DNS queries.

## How to Configure

1. **Create a Hosted Zone**: If you don't already have one, create a hosted zone for your domain.
2. **Create Records**: Add multiple records for the same domain name, each with a different IP address.
3. **Enable Health Checks**: Optionally, configure health checks for each IP address to ensure only healthy addresses are returned.

## Example

```yaml
example.com. 300 IN A 192.0.2.1
example.com. 300 IN A 192.0.2.2
example.com. 300 IN A 192.0.2.3
```

In this example, DNS queries for `example.com` will return all three IP addresses, allowing the client to choose one.

## Benefits

- **Improved Availability**: By providing multiple IP addresses, you reduce the risk of downtime.
- **Better Performance**: Distributing traffic across multiple resources can improve response times.

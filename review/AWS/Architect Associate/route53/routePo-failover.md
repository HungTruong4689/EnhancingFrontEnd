# Route 53 Failover Routing Policy

Amazon Route 53's failover routing policy is used to route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy or to a different resource when the first resource is unhealthy. This is useful for creating highly available and fault-tolerant applications.

## Key Concepts

- **Primary and Secondary Resources**: You define primary and secondary resources. Route 53 monitors the health of the primary resource and routes traffic to it when it is healthy. If the primary resource becomes unhealthy, Route 53 routes traffic to the secondary resource.
- **Health Checks**: Route 53 uses health checks to determine the health of your resources. You can configure health checks to monitor the health of your endpoints and specify what constitutes a healthy or unhealthy endpoint.

## Configuration Steps

1. **Create Health Checks**: Set up health checks for your primary and secondary resources.
2. **Create Failover Records**: Create DNS records for your primary and secondary resources, specifying the failover routing policy.
3. **Test Failover**: Simulate a failure of the primary resource to ensure that Route 53 correctly routes traffic to the secondary resource.

## Example

Here is an example of how to configure failover routing in Route 53:

1. **Create Health Checks**:
    - Go to the Route 53 console.
    - Create a health check for your primary resource.
    - Create a health check for your secondary resource.

2. **Create DNS Records**:
    - Create an A record for your primary resource with the failover routing policy set to "Primary".
    - Create an A record for your secondary resource with the failover routing policy set to "Secondary".

3. **Test Failover**:
    - Simulate a failure of the primary resource by stopping the service or changing the health check configuration.
    - Verify that Route 53 routes traffic to the secondary resource.

## Conclusion

Using Route 53's failover routing policy helps ensure that your application remains available even if a primary resource fails. By configuring health checks and failover records, you can create a robust and resilient DNS setup.

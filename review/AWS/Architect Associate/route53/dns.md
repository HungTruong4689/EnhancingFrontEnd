# Domain Name System (DNS)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network.

## Key Components of DNS

- **Domain Names**: Human-readable addresses (e.g., www.example.com).
- **IP Addresses**: Numerical labels assigned to devices (e.g., 192.0.2.1).
- **DNS Servers**: Servers that store DNS records and respond to queries.

## How DNS Works

1. **Query**: A user types a domain name into their browser.
2. **Resolution**: The browser sends a query to a DNS resolver.
3. **Response**: The DNS resolver queries other DNS servers to find the IP address.
4. **Connection**: The browser connects to the IP address and loads the website.

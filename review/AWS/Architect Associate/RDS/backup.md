# Backing Up in RDS, Aurora, and Aurora Clone in AWS

## Amazon RDS Backups

Amazon RDS provides two types of backups for your DB instances:

1. **Automated Backups**: 
    - Automatically enabled when you create an RDS instance.
    - Retention period can be configured from 1 to 35 days.
    - Includes daily snapshots and transaction logs.

2. **Manual Snapshots**:
    - User-initiated backups.
    - Retained until explicitly deleted.
    - Can be used to create a new DB instance.

## Amazon Aurora Backups

Amazon Aurora automatically backs up your database volume and retains restore data for the duration of the backup retention period (1 to 35 days). Key features include:

- **Continuous Backups**: 
  - Continuous backups to Amazon S3.
  - No performance impact on the database.

- **Manual Snapshots**:
  - Similar to RDS, user-initiated and retained until deleted.
  - Can be shared with other AWS accounts.

## Amazon Aurora Cloning

Aurora Cloning allows you to create a copy of your database cluster with minimal space and time requirements. Key points include:

- **Fast and Space-efficient**:
  - Uses copy-on-write protocol.
  - Only changes are stored, reducing storage costs.

- **Use Cases**:
  - Ideal for development, testing, and running analytical queries without impacting the source database.

### Steps to Create an Aurora Clone

1. Navigate to the Amazon RDS console.
2. Select the Aurora cluster you want to clone.
3. Choose "Actions" and then "Create clone".
4. Configure the clone settings and launch the clone.

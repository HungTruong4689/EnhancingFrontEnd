# Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases.

## Key Features

- **High Performance and Scalability**: Aurora provides up to five times the throughput of standard MySQL and up to three times the throughput of standard PostgreSQL.
- **High Availability and Durability**: Aurora replicates six copies of your data across three Availability Zones and continuously backs up your data to Amazon S3.
- **Security**: Aurora provides multiple levels of security for your database, including network isolation using Amazon VPC, encryption at rest using keys you create and control through AWS Key Management Service (KMS), and encryption of data in transit using SSL.
- **Fully Managed**: Aurora is fully managed by Amazon RDS, which automates time-consuming administration tasks like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

## Use Cases

- **Enterprise Applications**: Suitable for high-performance enterprise applications that require high availability and durability.
- **Software as a Service (SaaS)**: Ideal for SaaS applications that need a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective database solution.
- **Web and Mobile Applications**: Perfect for web and mobile applications that require a database with high throughput and low latency.

## Getting Started

To get started with Amazon Aurora, you can use the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the RDS API to launch a new Aurora DB cluster.

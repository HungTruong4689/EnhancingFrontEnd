# Advances of Amazon Aurora in AWS

Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases.

## Key Advances

### 1. Performance and Scalability
- **High Throughput**: Aurora provides up to five times the throughput of standard MySQL and up to three times the throughput of standard PostgreSQL.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Aurora automatically scales storage from 10GB up to 128TB as needed.
- **Read Replicas**: Supports up to 15 low-latency read replicas across three Availability Zones.

### 2. High Availability and Durability
- **Fault-Tolerant**: Data is replicated six ways across three Availability Zones.
- **Automated Backups**: Continuous backups to Amazon S3 with point-in-time recovery.
- **Self-Healing Storage**: Automatically detects and repairs disk failures.

### 3. Security
- **Encryption**: Data is encrypted at rest and in transit using AWS Key Management Service (KMS).
- **Network Isolation**: Aurora can be run in an Amazon VPC, isolating the database in your own virtual network.
- **Compliance**: Meets various compliance standards including HIPAA, PCI DSS, and ISO/IEC 27001.

### 4. Cost-Effectiveness
- **Pay-as-You-Go**: Only pay for the storage and I/O you use.
- **Serverless Option**: Aurora Serverless automatically adjusts capacity based on application needs, reducing costs for variable workloads.

### 5. Advanced Monitoring and Management
- **Performance Insights**: Provides a dashboard to visualize database performance.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Integrated with CloudWatch for monitoring and alerting.
- **Automated Patching**: Aurora automatically applies patches and updates.

## Conclusion
Amazon Aurora offers a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for modern database needs, combining the best of commercial and open-source databases with the reliability and security of AWS.

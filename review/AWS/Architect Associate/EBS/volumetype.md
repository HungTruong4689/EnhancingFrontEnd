# EBS Volume Types in AWS

Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) provides different volume types to support various use cases. Here are the main EBS volume types:

## General Purpose SSD (gp3 and gp2)
- **gp3**: Offers higher performance at a lower cost compared to gp2. It provides baseline performance of 3,000 IOPS and 125 MiB/s, with the ability to provision up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MiB/s.
- **gp2**: Provides a balance of price and performance for a wide variety of workloads. Baseline performance is 3 IOPS per GiB, with the ability to burst up to 3,000 IOPS.

## Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2 and io1)
- **io2**: Designed for critical applications that require sustained IOPS performance, high durability, and high throughput. Offers up to 64,000 IOPS per volume.
- **io1**: Similar to io2 but with lower durability. Provides up to 64,000 IOPS per volume.

## Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)
- **st1**: Low-cost HDD volume designed for frequently accessed, throughput-intensive workloads. Provides up to 500 MiB/s of throughput.

## Cold HDD (sc1)
- **sc1**: Lowest cost HDD volume designed for less frequently accessed workloads. Provides up to 250 MiB/s of throughput.

## Magnetic (Standard)
- **Standard**: Previous generation HDD volume, suitable for workloads where data is infrequently accessed. Provides lower performance compared to other volume types.

## Summary
Each EBS volume type is designed to meet different performance and cost requirements. Choose the appropriate volume type based on your workload needs.

- **gp3**: Cost-effective SSD with high performance.
- **gp2**: General-purpose SSD for a variety of workloads.
- **io2**: High-performance SSD for critical applications.
- **io1**: High-performance SSD with lower durability.
- **st1**: Throughput-optimized HDD for frequently accessed data.
- **sc1**: Cold HDD for infrequently accessed data.
- **Standard**: Legacy HDD for infrequent access.

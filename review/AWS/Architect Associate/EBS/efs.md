# Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is a scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is designed to be highly available and durable, providing simple and scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances.

## Key Features

- **Scalability**: Automatically scales your file system storage capacity up or down as you add or remove files.
- **Availability and Durability**: Designed for high availability and durability, storing data redundantly across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- **Performance Modes**: Offers two performance modes, General Purpose and Max I/O, to optimize for different workloads.
- **Access Control**: Supports POSIX permissions and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for fine-grained access control.
- **Encryption**: Provides encryption of data at rest and in transit.

## Use Cases

- **Web Serving and Content Management**: Ideal for web serving, content management, and media processing workflows.
- **Big Data and Analytics**: Suitable for big data and analytics applications that require high throughput and IOPS.
- **Backup and Restore**: Can be used for backup and restore solutions, providing a scalable and cost-effective storage option.
- **Development and Testing**: Useful for development and testing environments that require shared access to file data.

## Getting Started

1. **Create an EFS File System**: Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs to create a new EFS file system.
2. **Mount the File System**: Mount the EFS file system to your Amazon EC2 instances using the NFSv4.1 protocol.
3. **Manage and Monitor**: Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the performance and usage of your EFS file system.

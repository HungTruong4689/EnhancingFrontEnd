# Application Load Balancer (ALB) in AWS

## Overview
An Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones.

## Features
- **Content-based routing**: Routes traffic based on the content of the request (e.g., URL path, host header).
- **SSL/TLS termination**: Offloads the SSL/TLS encryption and decryption work from your targets.
- **WebSocket support**: Supports WebSocket and HTTP/2 protocols.
- **Health checks**: Monitors the health of registered targets and routes traffic only to healthy targets.
- **Integration with AWS services**: Works seamlessly with other AWS services like Auto Scaling, ECS, and EKS.

## Use Cases
- **Microservices**: Ideal for applications with a microservices architecture.
- **Containerized applications**: Works well with containerized applications running on ECS or EKS.
- **Dynamic content**: Suitable for applications that require content-based routing.

## Pricing
ALB pricing is based on the number of Load Balancers, the number of new connections per second, and the amount of data processed by the Load Balancer.

## Getting Started
1. **Create an ALB**: Use the AWS Management Console, CLI, or SDKs to create an ALB.
2. **Configure listeners**: Set up listeners to check for connection requests from clients.
3. **Register targets**: Add targets to the target group to which the ALB will route traffic.
4. **Set up routing rules**: Define rules to route traffic based on content.

## Conclusion
Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a powerful tool for managing and distributing application traffic, providing high availability, security, and performance for your applications.

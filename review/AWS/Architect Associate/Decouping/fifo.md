# AWS SQS FIFO

## Overview
Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to ensure that the order of messages is preserved and that each message is processed exactly once.

## Key Features
- **Order**: Messages are received and processed in the exact order they are sent.
- **Duplication Prevention**: Ensures that each message is delivered and processed exactly once.
- **High Throughput**: Supports high throughput with up to 300 transactions per second (TPS).

## Use Cases
- **Financial Transactions**: Ensuring the order of transactions is maintained.
- **Inventory Management**: Processing orders in the sequence they are received.
- **Task Scheduling**: Maintaining the order of tasks in a workflow.

## Creating a FIFO Queue
1. Open the Amazon SQS console.
2. Choose "Create New Queue".
3. Select "FIFO" as the queue type.
4. Configure the queue settings and create the queue.

## Best Practices
- Use message grouping to ensure messages that need to be processed together are sent in the same group.
- Monitor and scale your queues to handle varying loads.
- Implement error handling and retries to manage message processing failures.

## Conclusion
AWS SQS FIFO queues provide a reliable way to ensure message order and exactly-once processing, making them ideal for applications where the order of operations is critical.

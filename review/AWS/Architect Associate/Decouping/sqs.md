# Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. 

## Key Features

- **Decoupling**: SQS allows you to decouple application components so that they run independently.
- **Scalability**: Automatically scales to handle any amount of traffic.
- **Reliability**: Ensures delivery of messages with multiple copies stored redundantly.
- **Security**: Provides secure communication between services with encryption and access control.

## Types of Queues

1. **Standard Queues**: 
    - Unlimited throughput.
    - At-least-once delivery.
    - Best-effort ordering.

2. **FIFO Queues**:
    - First-In-First-Out delivery.
    - Exactly-once processing.
    - Limited throughput.

## Use Cases

- **Microservices Communication**: Decouple microservices to improve fault tolerance.
- **Task Queues**: Manage background tasks and offload processing.
- **Message Buffers**: Smooth out traffic spikes by buffering messages.

## Basic Operations

- **SendMessage**: Send a message to the queue.

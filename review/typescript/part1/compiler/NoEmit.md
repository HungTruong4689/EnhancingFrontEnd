# TypeScript `noEmitOnError` Option

The `noEmitOnError` option in TypeScript is a compiler flag that prevents the TypeScript compiler from emitting JavaScript files if there are any type errors in the code. This is useful for ensuring that only type-safe code is compiled and deployed.

## Usage

To enable `noEmitOnError`, add it to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "noEmitOnError": true
    }
}
```

Alternatively, you can use the command line option:

```sh
tsc --noEmitOnError
```

## Example

Consider the following TypeScript code with a type error:

```typescript
let myNumber: number = "This is a string"; // Type error
```

With `noEmitOnError` enabled, the compiler will not generate a JavaScript file for this code.

## Benefits

- Ensures type safety by preventing the emission of code with type errors.
- Helps maintain code quality and reliability.

## Conclusion

Using the `noEmitOnError` option is a good practice to ensure that only type-safe code is emitted, which can help prevent runtime errors and improve the overall quality of your TypeScript projects.
